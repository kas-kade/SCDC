    <P>There are eight planets in total in our solar system. Earth, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, Venus, Mars, and
        Mercury are all of the eight planets inside solar system.The moon is not considered a planet because it's just a
        very big piece of rock and sun is the largest in our solar system and its a star.

        <li>At first i make my trip to <u>planet sigma</u>, after arriving about two miniuts later i come accros the
            sigmas.
            The sigmas are squidward looking alieans that do not stop mewing, they have a blue greenish skin. they treat
            me
            with teaching me how to mew and i make my way off the the other planets</li>
        <li>I make my way to planet ohio, they have a bunch of betas that worl for the skibidi toilets, they would serve
            them with skibidi slicers and other treats.Some would be servants or farmers or other job duties, when i got
            there they tried there best to make me stay at there planet but when I refused tv man came after me so i ran
            to
            my rocket ship and went to the next planet</li>
        <li>I went to the planet of mars and i came across the undergrowers, they are animal alien people the grow under
            the
            ground until 18 and they come up from under the ground, they look like really big squrles but they are real
            nice.Theu are really strong but they can get upset very eaily so i tried tobe the nicest i possibly could
            with
            them</li>
