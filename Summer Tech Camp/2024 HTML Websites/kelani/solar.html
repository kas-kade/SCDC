   <p>Within Greek
      mythology, Uranus was the primordial sky god, who was ultimately succeeded by Zeus, who ruled the celestial
      realm
      atop Mount Olympus.
      In contrast to the celestial Olympians was the chthonic deity Hades, who ruled the underworld,
      and Poseidon, who ruled the sea.Roman goddesses of the moon, and their Greek counterparts, were said to be
      formed
      in
      a triadic
      manner hence Luna was associated with two further goddesses, Diana and Hecate. Luna was the goddess in heaven
      and
      of
      the full moon
      (Greek counterpart being Selene),
      Diana was the goddess on earth and of the halfmoon (Greek Artemis) and Hecate (or Hekate) was the goddess in
      the
      underworld and of the dark moon</p>
